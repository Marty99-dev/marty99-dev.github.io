## About Me

I am a highly motivated graduate with a strong interest in cybersecurity, particularly cryptography and theoretical computer science. I recently completed a **Master’s degree in Cybersecurity at EPFL and ETHZ**, where I specialized in theoretical and mathematically oriented courses. Prior to that, I earned my **Bachelor’s degree from a University of Applied Sciences**, where I focused on practical programming, systems, and project-based learning.

In my free time, I collaborate with 
 - Dr. Jonathan Bootle and Prof. Alessandro Chiesa on proving the security of linear-time interactive oracle proofs; and
 - with Prof. Eylon Yogev on establishing lower bounds for digital signatures.  

I am currently seeking **research-oriented job and PhD opportunities** and am eager to apply my skills to challenging projects.
