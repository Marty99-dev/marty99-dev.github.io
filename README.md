I am a highly motivated graduate with a strong interest in cybersecurity, particularly cryptography and theoretical computer science. I recently completed a Masterâ€™s degree in Cybersecurity at EPFL, where I specialized in theoretical and mathematically oriented courses. In my free time, I collaborate with Dr. Jonathan Bootle and Prof. Alessandro Chiesa on proving the security of linear-time interactive oracle proofs, and with Prof. Eylon Yogev on establishing lower bounds for digital signatures. I am currently seeking research-oriented job and PhD opportunities!
